# Overview
This is the second portion of the class, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

In this project, we are tasked these parts:

1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
2. Provide a basic summary of the data.
3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if thereâ€™s other approaches worth considering)
4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.

# Exercise

#### Loading add-on package
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```


#### **1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses**
```{r}
data(ToothGrowth)  # ToothGrowth dataset
str(ToothGrowth)
```

#### **2. Provide a basic summary of the data.**
```{r}
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, aes(x = supp, y = len)) +
         geom_boxplot(aes(fill = supp))

ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, aes(x = supp, y = len)) +
         geom_boxplot(aes(fill = supp)) + facet_wrap(~ dose)
```

#### **3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose.**

The T-test by dose:
```{r}
t.test(ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$dose == 1], ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5],
       paired = FALSE, alternative = "greater")$p.value

t.test(ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$dose == 2], ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$dose == 1],
       paired = FALSE, alternative = "greater")$p.value
```
Note: Increaseng doseages increase mean tooth length.


The T-test by supp:
```{r}
t.test(len ~ supp, data = ToothGrowth, paired = FALSE)$p.value
```
Note: The p-value of OJ vs. VC is 0.06, which is greater than 0.05, so I accept the null hypothesis. but...

The T-test by supp for each dose:
```{r}
t.test(len ~ supp, ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5, ], paired = FALSE)$p.value
t.test(len ~ supp, ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose == 1, ], paired = FALSE)$p.value
t.test(len ~ supp, ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose == 2, ], paired = FALSE)$p.value
```
Note: 

In case of doseages is **0.5**, the p-value of OJ vs. VC is 0.006, which is less than 0.05, so I **DO NOT** accept the null hypothesis.

In case of doseages is **1.0**, the p-value of OJ vs. VC is 0.001, which is less than 0.05, so I **DO NOT** accept the null hypothesis.

In case of doseages is **2.0**, the p-value of OJ vs. VC is 0.964, which is greater than 0.05, so I accept the null hypothesis.


#### **4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.**

- Increaseng doseages increase mean tooth length.

- Orange juice (OJ) increase tooth length unless doseage is 2.0.
